[INTERACTIVE EXECUTION GUIDE]

This document guides step-by-step execution when running the PROCESS_1.txt methodology interactively. Use this when implementing a project phase by phase, with human review between phases.

[CURRENT STATE AWARENESS]

Before proceeding to next phase, AI agent MUST:
- Read IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md completely
- Identify which phase separator was last completed
- Count total STEP_XX entries present
- Determine next phase based on step count

Phase identification table:
- 1 step present → Next: expand to 3 steps
- 3 steps present → Next: expand to 6 steps
- 6 steps present → Next: expand to 12 steps
- 12 steps present → Next: expand to 24 steps
- 24 steps present → Next: expand to 36 steps
- 36 steps present → Next: add 6 checkpoints (42 total)
- 42 steps present → Next: split checkpoints to 12 validations (48 total)
- 48 steps present → Next: add 4 release gateways (52 total)
- 52 steps present → Next: split gateways to 8 (56 total)
- 56 steps present → COMPLETE, no next phase

[EXECUTION PROTOCOL]

When user says "next phase" or "continue" or "proceed":

STEP 1: Read current IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
STEP 2: Identify current step count
STEP 3: Announce: "Current state: X steps detected. Next phase: expand to Y steps."
STEP 4: Execute appropriate expansion from PROCESS_1.txt methodology
STEP 5: Update IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md with new phase below last separator
STEP 6: Add new "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->" separator before new content
STEP 7: Commit with message describing phase transition (X → Y steps)
STEP 8: Push to remote
STEP 9: Announce completion: "Phase complete. Now at Y steps. Ready for next phase."

[PHASE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS]

PHASE: 1 → 3 STEPS
Action: Take single vision statement and split into three fundamental phases
Formula: [SPLIT]03 = 01 STAPPENPLAN × 3
Result: 3 STAPPENPLAN total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-3) at this phase
Patterns: beginning/middle/end, setup/execute/verify, foundation/build/deliver
Preserve: Original 1 step visible above separator

PHASE: 3 → 6 STEPS
Action: Take each of 3 STAPPENPLAN, double to 6 high-level steps
Formula: [DOUBLE]06 = 03 STAPPENPLAN × 2
Result: 6 STAPPENPLAN total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-6) at this phase
Preserve: All original 3 STAPPENPLAN visible above separator

PHASE: 6 → 12 STEPS
Action: Take each of 6 STAPPENPLAN, split into 2 steps each
Formula: [DOUBLE]12 = 06 STAPPENPLAN × 2
Result: 12 STAPPENPLAN total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-12) at this phase
Preserve: All original 6 STAPPENPLAN visible above separator

PHASE: 12 → 24 STEPS
Action: Take each of 12 STAPPENPLAN, split into 2 steps each
Formula: [DOUBLE]24 = 12 STAPPENPLAN × 2
Result: 24 STAPPENPLAN total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-24) at this phase
Preserve: All previous phases visible above separator

PHASE: 24 → 36 STEPS
Action: Identify 12 most complex STAPPENPLAN from 24, split only those into 2 each
Formula: [SPLIT]36 = 24 STAPPENPLAN + 12 STAPPENPLAN
Result: 12 simple + 24 complex = 36 STAPPENPLAN total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-36), may use a/b notation for complex splits initially
Preserve: All previous phases visible above separator

PHASE: 36 → 42 STEPS (ADD CHECKPOINTS)
Action: Keep all 36 STAPPENPLAN, insert 6 validation checkpoints at strategic points
Formula: [INIT]42 = 36 STAPPENPLAN + 06 CHECKLIST
Result: 36 STAPPENPLAN + 6 validation = 42 steps total
Checkpoint format: Must include test file path, atomic tests list, 1-test-1-validation reminder
Naming: Continue numbered list incorporating checkpoints
Preserve: All previous phases visible above separator

PHASE: 42 → 48 STEPS (SPLIT CHECKPOINTS)
Action: Keep all 36 implementation STAPPENPLAN, split 6 checkpoints into 12 validations
Formula: [DOUBLE]48 = 36 STAPPENPLAN + 12 CHECKLIST
Result: 36 STAPPENPLAN + 12 validation = 48 steps total
Naming: MUST renumber everything as STEP_01 through STEP_48
Validation format: Each validation has 3 dash items minimum
Preserve: All previous phases visible above separator
CRITICAL: This is final STAPPENPLAN implementation phase - use STEP_XX notation

PHASE: 48 → 52 STEPS (ADD GATEWAYS)
Action: Keep all 48 steps (36 STAPPENPLAN + 12 CHECKLIST), insert 4 release gateways at major milestones
Formula: [INIT]52 = 48 STEPS + 04 GATEWAY
Result: 48 steps + 4 gateways = 52 items total
Gateway positions: After foundation, after validation infrastructure, after core system, after final validation
Gateway format: Similar to checkpoints but spans multiple domains
Naming: Steps remain STEP_XX, gateways use GATEWAY_01 through GATEWAY_04
Preserve: All previous phases visible above separator

PHASE: 52 → 56 STEPS (SPLIT GATEWAYS)
Action: Keep all 48 steps (36 STAPPENPLAN + 12 CHECKLIST), split 4 gateways into 8 (automated + manual review)
Formula: [DOUBLE]56 = 48 STEPS + 08 GATEWAY
Result: 48 steps + 8 gateways = 56 items total
Gateway format: Automated gateways run deterministic tests, manual gateways require human sign-off
Naming: GATEWAY_01 through GATEWAY_08
Preserve: All previous phases visible above separator
FINAL: This is completion phase

[VALIDATION BEFORE PROCEEDING]

Before executing next phase, verify:
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md exists and is readable
- [ ] Current phase has correct separator "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->"
- [ ] Step count matches expected number for current phase
- [ ] Git working directory is clean (or changes are intentional)
- [ ] Currently on correct development branch

-----

[ERROR RECOVERY]

If step count doesn't match expected progression:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report discrepancy to user
3. Ask user: "Detected X steps but expected Y. Proceed with recovery or manual intervention?"
4. Wait for user confirmation before continuing

If IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md missing or corrupted:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report error to user
3. Do NOT attempt automatic recovery
4. Wait for user to restore or provide guidance
