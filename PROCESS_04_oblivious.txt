[INTERACTIVE EXECUTION GUIDE - COMPACT VARIANT]

This document guides step-by-step execution when running the PROCESS_04.txt methodology interactively. Use this when implementing a project using compact progression: power-of-two doubling for actions, incremental checkpoints, incremental gateways. Human review between phases. Most minimal complete process.

[CURRENT STATE AWARENESS]

Before proceeding to next phase, AI agent MUST:
- Read IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md completely
- Identify which phase separator was last completed
- Count total STEP_XX entries present
- Determine next phase based on step count

Phase identification table (Compact progression with density):
- 1 step present → Next: mitosis to 2 steps
- 2 steps present → Next: mitosis to 4 steps
- 4 steps present → Next: mitosis to 8 steps (execution phase complete)
- 8 steps present → Next: add 2 checkpoints based on density 8/4 (10 total)
- 10 steps present → Next: checkpoint mitosis based on density 8/2 (12 total)
- 12 steps present → Next: add 1 gateway based on density 8/8 (13 total)
- 13 steps present → Next: gateway mitosis based on density 8/4 (14 total)
- 14 steps present → COMPLETE, no next phase

Phase categories:
- 1→8: Execution steps only (power-of-two mitosis)
- 8→12: Checkpoint insertion (density-based: 8/4=2, mitosis to 8/2=4)
- 12→14: Gateway insertion (density-based: 8/8=1, mitosis to 8/4=2)

Critical concept: All checkpoints and gateways calculated from fixed 8 execution steps, NOT from total accumulated count.

[EXECUTION PROTOCOL]

When user says "next phase" or "continue" or "proceed":

STEP 1: Read current IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
STEP 2: Identify current step count
STEP 3: Determine phase category (action/checkpoint/gateway)
STEP 4: Announce: "Current state: X steps detected. Phase: [action/checkpoint/gateway]. Next: expand to Y steps."
STEP 5: Execute appropriate expansion from PROCESS_04.txt methodology
STEP 6: Update IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md with new phase below last separator
STEP 7: Add new "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->" separator before new content
STEP 8: Commit with message describing phase transition (X → Y steps)
STEP 9: Push to remote
STEP 10: Announce completion: "Phase complete. Now at Y steps. Ready for next phase."

[PHASE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS - EXECUTION MITOSIS]

PHASE: 1 → 2 STEPS
Action: Split single vision into two fundamental execution steps through mitosis
Method: Identify primary dichotomy (prep/exec, design/implement)
Mitosis: 1 × 2 = 2
Formula: [MITOSE]02 = 01 STAPPENPLAN + 01 STAPPENPLAN
Result: 2 execution steps total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-2) at this phase
Category: Execution mitosis phase

PHASE: 2 → 4 STEPS
Action: Take two execution steps and apply mitosis to reach four
Method: Each of two steps splits into two sub-steps
Mitosis: 2 × 2 = 4
Formula: [MITOSE]04 = 01 STAPPENPLAN + 01 STAPPENPLAN + 02 STAPPENPLAN
Result: 4 execution steps total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-4) at this phase
Category: Execution mitosis phase

PHASE: 4 → 8 STEPS
Action: Take four execution steps and apply mitosis to reach eight
Method: Each of four steps splits into two focused steps
Mitosis: 4 × 2 = 8 (final execution mitosis)
Formula: [MITOSE]08 = 01 STAPPENPLAN + 01 STAPPENPLAN + 02 STAPPENPLAN + 04 STAPPENPLAN
Result: 8 execution steps total (FIXED)
Naming: Use numbered list (1-8) at this phase
Note: This completes execution step mitosis - 8 is the fixed execution count
Category: Execution mitosis phase (final)
Critical: All subsequent densities calculated from these 8 fixed execution steps

-----

[PHASE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS - CHECKPOINT DENSITY]

PHASE: 8 → 10 STEPS (INITIAL CHECKPOINT DENSITY)
Action: Keep all 8 execution steps fixed, insert 2 checkpoints based on density
Method: Calculate density from 8 execution steps: 8/4 = 2 checkpoints

Checkpoint format: Test file path, atomic tests, 1-test-1-validation, TDD cycle
Naming: Continue numbered list incorporating checkpoints
Category: Checkpoint density phase (initial)
Transition: From execution mitosis to checkpoint density insertion

PHASE: 10 → 12 STEPS (CHECKPOINT MITOSIS DENSITY)

Formula: [INIT]13 = 01 STAPPENPLAN + 01 STAPPENPLAN + 02 STAPPENPLAN + 04 STAPPENPLAN + 02 CHECKLIST + 02 CHECKLIST + 01 GATEWAY
Result: 12 steps + 1 gateway = 13 items total
Gateway format: Aggregates checkpoints, adds integration tests, blocks progression
Naming: Steps remain numbered, gateway uses GATEWAY_01
Category: Gateway density phase (initial)
Transition: From checkpoint density to gateway density insertion

PHASE: 13 → 14 STEPS (GATEWAY MITOSIS DENSITY)
Action: Keep all 12 steps fixed (8 execution + 4 checklists), apply mitosis to gateway
Method: Calculate new density from 8 execution steps: 8/4 = 2 gateways
Density: Mitosis doubles gateways - one gateway per four execution steps
Formula: [MITOSE]14 = 01 STAPPENPLAN + 01 STAPPENPLAN + 02 STAPPENPLAN + 04 STAPPENPLAN + 02 CHECKLIST + 02 CHECKLIST + 01 GATEWAY + 01 GATEWAY
Result: 12 steps + 2 gateways = 14 items total
Gateway types: Each has automated tests and manual review criteria
Naming: GATEWAY_01 and GATEWAY_02, all items renumbered STEP_01 through STEP_14
Category: Gateway density phase (mitosis - FINAL)
CRITICAL: This is final phase - renumber everything as STEP_XX
Final composition: 8 execution + 4 checklists + 2 gateways = 14 steps

[VALIDATION BEFORE PROCEEDING]

Before executing next phase, verify:
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md exists and is readable
- [ ] Current phase has correct separator "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->"
- [ ] Step count matches expected number for current phase
- [ ] Identify if in action phase (1-8), checkpoint phase (8-13), or gateway phase (13-19)
- [ ] For doubling phases (1-8), verify each step doubled correctly
- [ ] Git working directory is clean (or changes are intentional)
- [ ] Currently on correct development branch

-----

[ERROR RECOVERY]

If step count doesn't match expected compact progression:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report discrepancy to user
3. Identify which phase category (action/checkpoint/gateway)
4. Check if at doubling phase (should be 1, 2, 4, or 8)
5. Check if at checkpoint phase (should be 10, 12, or 13)
6. Check if at gateway phase (should be 15 or 19)
7. Ask user: "Detected X steps but expected Y. Proceed with recovery or manual intervention?"
8. Wait for user confirmation before continuing

If phase category ambiguous:
1. Reference phase boundaries: 1-8 (action), 8-13 (checkpoint), 13-19 (gateway)
2. If steps = 1, 2, 4, or 8: action doubling phase
3. If steps = 10, 12, or 13: checkpoint insertion phase
4. If steps = 15 or 19: gateway insertion phase
5. If confusion persists, ask user which phase to execute

If IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md missing or corrupted:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report error to user
3. Do NOT attempt automatic recovery
4. Wait for user to restore or provide guidance

[PROGRESSION SUMMARY]

Compact PROCESS_04 progression map with density logic:

Phase 1 - Execution Mitosis (Power of Two):
1 → 2 → 4 → 8 steps
Pure execution steps, no validation yet
Mitosis at each phase: ×2 → ×2 → ×2
Goal: Fixed 8 execution steps (basis for all density calculations)

Phase 2 - Checkpoint Density (Calculated from 8 exec steps):
8 → 10 → 12 steps
Density 8/4=2 checkpoints, mitosis to density 8/2=4 checkpoints
Density additions: 8/4 → 8/2 (interval halves)
Goal: 4 validation checkpoints for coverage

Phase 3 - Gateway Density (Calculated from 8 exec steps):
12 → 13 → 14 steps
Density 8/8=1 gateway, mitosis to density 8/4=2 gateways
Density additions: 8/8 → 8/4 (interval halves)
Goal: 2 release gateways for staged verification

Final composition at 14 steps:
- 8 execution steps (FIXED)
- 4 checkpoint steps (density from 8 exec: 8/4 → 8/2)
- 2 gateway steps (density from 8 exec: 8/8 → 8/4)
- Total: 14 items (most compact complete process)

Density formulas used:
- Checkpoints: 8 exec / checkpoint_interval
- Gateways: 8 exec / gateway_interval
- Mitosis halves interval, doubles count

- Time-constrained planning phases
- 8 major execution steps provide sufficient granularity
- Team experienced enough to work from higher-level steps
- Speed and agility prioritized over exhaustive decomposition
- Need validation and gateways but minimal execution detail
- Prefer mathematically deterministic density calculations

[COMPLETION SIGNAL]

When 19 steps reached:
1. Announce: "COMPACT PROCESS COMPLETE. Implementation plan contains:"
2. Detail: "- 8 action/execution steps (minimal essential set)"
3. Detail: "- 5 validation checkpoint steps"
4. Detail: "- 6 release gateway steps"
5. Detail: "- Total: 19 items following compact progression (1→2→4→8→10→12→13→15→19)"
6. Note: "This is the most compact complete process variant."
7. Suggest: "Ready to begin STEP_01 execution, or require further refinement?"
8. Do NOT proceed to execution without explicit user instruction

[ADVANTAGES AND TRADEOFFS]

Advantages of PROCESS_04:
- Fastest planning completion (only 9 phases)
- Minimal overhead, maximum agility
- Forces essential high-level thinking
- Still maintains quality through checkpoints and gateways
- Easy to communicate entire plan
- Reduces planning paralysis
- Ideal for experienced teams

Tradeoffs of PROCESS_04:
- Less implementation granularity (8 vs 21-36 actions in other processes)
- Requires more execution-time decision making
- May need ad-hoc sub-tasks during execution
- Less suitable for complex enterprise projects
- Not ideal for junior teams needing detailed guidance
- Assumes team can decompose 8 high-level steps into execution

Best practices when using PROCESS_04:
- Ensure each of 8 action steps is truly actionable
- Document assumptions within each high-level step
- Be prepared to create sub-tasks during execution
- Leverage checkpoints to catch issues early
- Use gateways as decision points for detailed planning if needed
- Consider this as "just enough" planning approach
