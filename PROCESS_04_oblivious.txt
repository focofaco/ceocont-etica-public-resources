[INTERACTIVE EXECUTION GUIDE - COMPACT VARIANT]

This document guides step-by-step execution when running the PROCESS_04.txt methodology interactively. Use this when implementing a project using compact progression: power-of-two doubling for actions, incremental checkpoints, incremental gateways. Human review between phases. Most minimal complete process.

[CURRENT STATE AWARENESS]

Before proceeding to next phase, AI agent MUST:
- Read IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md completely
- Identify which phase separator was last completed
- Count total STEP_XX entries present
- Determine next phase based on step count

Phase identification table (Compact progression):
- 1 step present → Next: expand to 2 steps
- 2 steps present → Next: expand to 4 steps (double)
- 4 steps present → Next: expand to 8 steps (double)
- 8 steps present → Next: add 2 checkpoints (10 total)
- 10 steps present → Next: add 2 more checkpoints (12 total)
- 12 steps present → Next: add 1 more checkpoint (13 total)
- 13 steps present → Next: add 2 gateways (15 total)
- 15 steps present → Next: add 4 more gateways (19 total)
- 19 steps present → COMPLETE, no next phase

Phase categories:
- 1→8: Action steps only (power-of-two doubling)
- 8→13: Checkpoint insertion (incremental)
- 13→19: Gateway insertion (incremental)

-----

[EXECUTION PROTOCOL]

When user says "next phase" or "continue" or "proceed":

STEP 1: Read current IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
STEP 2: Identify current step count
STEP 3: Determine phase category (action/checkpoint/gateway)
STEP 4: Announce: "Current state: X steps detected. Phase: [action/checkpoint/gateway]. Next: expand to Y steps."
STEP 5: Execute appropriate expansion from PROCESS_04.txt methodology
STEP 6: Update IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md with new phase below last separator
STEP 7: Add new "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->" separator before new content
STEP 8: Commit with message describing phase transition (X → Y steps)
STEP 9: Push to remote
STEP 10: Announce completion: "Phase complete. Now at Y steps. Ready for next phase."

Doubling: 1 × 2 = 2
Result: 2 action steps total
Naming: Use numbered list (1-2) at this phase
Category: Action doubling phase

PHASE: 2 → 4 STEPS
Action: Take two action steps and double to four
Method: Each of two steps splits into two sub-steps

[VALIDATION BEFORE PROCEEDING]

Before executing next phase, verify:
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md exists and is readable
- [ ] Current phase has correct separator "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->"
- [ ] Step count matches expected number for current phase
- [ ] Identify if in action phase (1-8), checkpoint phase (8-13), or gateway phase (13-19)
- [ ] For doubling phases (1-8), verify each step doubled correctly
- [ ] Git working directory is clean (or changes are intentional)
- [ ] Currently on correct development branch

-----

[ERROR RECOVERY]

If step count doesn't match expected compact progression:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report discrepancy to user
3. Identify which phase category (action/checkpoint/gateway)
4. Check if at doubling phase (should be 1, 2, 4, or 8)
5. Check if at checkpoint phase (should be 10, 12, or 13)
6. Check if at gateway phase (should be 15 or 19)
7. Ask user: "Detected X steps but expected Y. Proceed with recovery or manual intervention?"
8. Wait for user confirmation before continuing

If phase category ambiguous:
1. Reference phase boundaries: 1-8 (action), 8-13 (checkpoint), 13-19 (gateway)
2. If steps = 1, 2, 4, or 8: action doubling phase
3. If steps = 10, 12, or 13: checkpoint insertion phase
4. If steps = 15 or 19: gateway insertion phase
5. If confusion persists, ask user which phase to execute

If IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md missing or corrupted:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report error to user
3. Do NOT attempt automatic recovery
4. Wait for user to restore or provide guidance

- Rapid prototyping or proof-of-concept work
- Time-constrained planning phases
- 8 major action steps provide sufficient granularity
- Team experienced enough to work from higher-level steps
- Speed and agility prioritized over exhaustive decomposition
- Still need validation and gateways but minimal action detail

-----

[COMPLETION SIGNAL]

When 19 steps reached:
1. Announce: "COMPACT PROCESS COMPLETE. Implementation plan contains:"
2. Detail: "- 8 action/execution steps (minimal essential set)"
3. Detail: "- 5 validation checkpoint steps"
4. Detail: "- 6 release gateway steps"
5. Detail: "- Total: 19 items following compact progression (1→2→4→8→10→12→13→15→19)"
6. Note: "This is the most compact complete process variant."
7. Suggest: "Ready to begin STEP_01 execution, or require further refinement?"
8. Do NOT proceed to execution without explicit user instruction

-----

[ADVANTAGES AND TRADEOFFS]

Advantages of PROCESS_04:
- Fastest planning completion (only 9 phases)
- Minimal overhead, maximum agility
- Forces essential high-level thinking
- Still maintains quality through checkpoints and gateways
- Easy to communicate entire plan
- Reduces planning paralysis
- Ideal for experienced teams

Tradeoffs of PROCESS_04:
- Less implementation granularity (8 vs 21-36 actions in other processes)
- Requires more execution-time decision making
- May need ad-hoc sub-tasks during execution
- Less suitable for complex enterprise projects
- Not ideal for junior teams needing detailed guidance
- Assumes team can decompose 8 high-level steps into execution

Best practices when using PROCESS_04:
- Ensure each of 8 action steps is truly actionable
- Document assumptions within each high-level step
- Be prepared to create sub-tasks during execution
- Leverage checkpoints to catch issues early
- Use gateways as decision points for detailed planning if needed
- Consider this as "just enough" planning approach
