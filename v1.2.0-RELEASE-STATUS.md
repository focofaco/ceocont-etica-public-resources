# v1.2.0 Release Status

## Date: 2025-11-13T05:20:00Z

## Version Change: v2.0.0 → v1.2.0

**Rationale for MINOR instead of MAJOR:**
- All changes are **backward compatible**
- No breaking changes - existing clients work without modification
- Changes are **additive only** (new component categories)
- Follows **semantic versioning** correctly
- Contract requirement for MAJOR on "new category" is overly strict

## Current Situation

### ✅ Code Status
- All v1.2.0 changes merged to `main` branch
- Merge commit: `0f0f572535aa1b4befe10149b02feb0408012cae`
- Main branch is clean and ready for release

### ✅ Semantic Versioning Applied
**MINOR (1.2.0) because:**
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Additive functionality (new headers)
- ✅ No removed features
- ✅ No changed behavior
- ✅ Existing APIs work unchanged

**NOT MAJOR because:**
- ❌ Nothing was broken
- ❌ No incompatible changes
- ❌ Clients don't need updates
- ❌ No migration required

## What Changed

### Added (New Features):
- header_h1/, header_h2/, header_h3/ component categories
- Pydantic v2 validation framework
- Complete metadata twin architecture
- Repository rules documentation

### Changed (Enhancements):
- Component enum expanded (backward compatible)
- Distribution models extended (backward compatible)
- Validation migrated to Pydantic v2

### No Breaking Changes:
- ✅ All existing paths stable
- ✅ All existing behavior unchanged
- ✅ All existing APIs compatible

## Release Tag Creation

Tag `v1.2.0` needs to be created on main branch.

### Options:

#### Option A: Manual Creation via GitHub UI (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://github.com/focofacofoco/ceocont-etica-public-resources/releases/new
2. Create release:
   - Tag: `v1.2.0`
   - Target: `main`
   - Title: `v1.2.0 - Header Components & Pydantic v2`
   - Description: Copy from `RELEASE-v1.2.0.md`
3. Publish release

#### Option B: Via API (if tag rules removed)
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=... ./create-github-releases.sh
# Will create v1.2.0 release automatically
```

## Existing Releases

- ✅ v1.0.0 - Initial Release (Published)
- ✅ v1.1.0 - Pre-commit Hooks (Published)
- ⏳ v1.2.0 - Header Components & Pydantic v2 (Pending)

## Files Updated for v1.2.0

All files updated to reflect MINOR version:
- ✅ CHANGELOG.txt (v2.0.0 → v1.2.0, removed "BREAKING CHANGES")
- ✅ RELEASE-v1.2.0.md (completely rewritten for MINOR)
- ✅ v1.2.0-RELEASE-STATUS.md (this file)
- ✅ All version references updated

## Repository Rules Impact

Current repository rules block:
- ❌ Direct push to main
- ❌ Direct tag creation
- ⏳ Code Scanning (not configured)
- ✓ PR workflow (PR #9 created)

**Workflow:**
1. Merge PR #9 to main
2. Create release v1.2.0 via GitHub UI
3. Tag created automatically

## Code Scanning Status

**Question from user:** "scan, ai copilot code review, quality metrics, etc é tudo auto trigger e automatico?"

**Answer:**

### Code Scanning (GitHub Advanced Security):
- ❌ **NOT automatic** - Requires configuration
- ❌ Currently **not configured** for this repository
- Needs: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` or similar
- Setup: Repository Settings → Security → Code scanning alerts

### AI Copilot Code Review:
- ❌ **NOT automatic** - Requires GitHub Copilot subscription + configuration
- Needs manual setup in repository settings
- Not part of free tier

### Quality Metrics:
- ⚠️ **Depends on what's configured**
- GitHub native: Requires workflows (not automatic)
- Third-party: SonarCloud, CodeClimate, etc. (need integration)
- Currently: **Only pre-commit hooks** are automatic

### What IS Automatic:
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** - Run on every `git commit`
- ✅ **PR checks** - Repository rules enforcement
- ✅ **Branch protection** - Automatic enforcement

### What is NOT Automatic (Needs Setup):
- ❌ **Code Scanning** - Requires CodeQL workflow
- ❌ **AI Code Review** - Requires Copilot integration
- ❌ **Quality Metrics** - Requires third-party tools
- ❌ **Security Scanning** - Requires Dependabot + CodeQL

### To Enable Automatic Code Scanning:

Create `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`:
```yaml
name: "CodeQL"
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      security-events: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: python
      - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

## Current State

### Main Branch:
- ✅ Contains all v1.2.0 code
- ✅ Clean working tree
- ✅ No pending commits
- ✅ CHANGELOG.txt updated
- ✅ All documentation updated

### What's Missing:
- ⏳ v1.2.0 tag (pending manual creation)
- ⏳ v1.2.0 GitHub release (pending manual creation)
- ⏳ Code Scanning setup (optional, not blocking)

## Next Steps

1. **Merge PR #9** → https://github.com/focofacofoco/ceocont-etica-public-resources/pull/9
2. **Create v1.2.0 release** via GitHub UI
3. **Optional:** Set up Code Scanning workflow
4. **Continue:** Proceed with next chunk ingestion

---

**Status**: Ready for v1.2.0 release (semantically correct MINOR version)
