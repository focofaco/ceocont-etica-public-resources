[INTERACTIVE EXECUTION GUIDE - FIBONACCI VARIANT]

This document guides step-by-step execution when running the PROCESS_2.txt methodology interactively.

-----

[HOW TO USE]

When user says "next phase" or "continue" or "proceed":

1. Read IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md completely
2. Count total STEP_XX entries present
3. Read PROCESS_2.txt and find the section that starts with @___[current_count]_
4. Execute that section's instructions
5. Add new phase below last "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->" separator
6. Commit and push

-----

[IMPORTANT]

- Only read the section of PROCESS_2.txt that matches your current step count
- Do NOT read ahead to future sections
- Trust the process - Fibonacci expansion naturally reveals next phase
- The process is complete when PROCESS_2.txt has no more sections to execute
