[INTERACTIVE EXECUTION GUIDE - HYBRID VARIANT]

This document guides step-by-step execution when running the PROCESS_03.txt methodology interactively. Use this when implementing a project using hybrid progression: Fibonacci-like action growth, checkpoint saturation, gateway completion. Human review between phases.

[CURRENT STATE AWARENESS]

Before proceeding to next phase, AI agent MUST:
- Read IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md completely
- Identify which phase separator was last completed
- Count total STEP_XX entries present
- Determine next phase based on step count

Phase identification table (Hybrid progression):
- 1 step present → Next: expand to 3 steps
- 3 steps present → Next: expand to 5 steps (3+2)
- 5 steps present → Next: expand to 8 steps (5+3)
- 8 steps present → Next: expand to 13 steps (8+5)
- 13 steps present → Next: expand to 21 steps (13+8)
- 21 steps present → Next: add 3 checkpoints (24 total)
- 24 steps present → Next: saturate with 8 more checkpoints (32 total)
- 32 steps present → Next: add 2 release gateways (34 total)
- 34 steps present → Next: expand to 6 gateways (38 total)
- 38 steps present → COMPLETE, no next phase

Phase categories:
- 1→21: Action/execution steps only (modified Fibonacci growth)
- 21→32: Checkpoint insertion and saturation (validation focus)
- 32→38: Gateway insertion (release verification focus)

-----

[EXECUTION PROTOCOL]

When user says "next phase" or "continue" or "proceed":

STEP 1: Read current IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
STEP 2: Identify current step count
STEP 3: Determine phase category (action/checkpoint/gateway)
STEP 4: Announce: "Current state: X steps detected. Phase: [action/checkpoint/gateway]. Next: expand to Y steps."
STEP 5: Execute appropriate expansion from PROCESS_03.txt methodology
STEP 6: Update IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md with new phase below last separator
STEP 7: Add new "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->" separator before new content
STEP 8: Commit with message describing phase transition (X → Y steps)
STEP 9: Push to remote
STEP 10: Announce completion: "Phase complete. Now at Y steps. Ready for next phase."

PHASE: 24 → 32 STEPS (CHECKPOINT SATURATION)
Action: Keep all 21 action steps and 3 existing checkpoints, add 8 more checkpoints
Method: Achieve high validation density, checkpoint after every 2-3 critical actions
Coverage: Directory structure, formats, naming, CI negative, CI positive, hashes, tree, determinism, changelog, versioning, upload, compliance
Result: 21 actions + 11 validations = 32 steps total
Checkpoint density: Approximately 1 checkpoint per 2 action steps

Action: Keep all 32 steps (21 actions + 11 validations), insert 2 release gateways
Method: Place gateways at major milestone boundaries
Gateway positions: Foundation complete, core system functional
Result: 32 steps + 2 gateways = 34 items total
Gateway format: Aggregates multiple checkpoints, adds integration tests, blocks progression

Category: Gateway insertion phase (initial)
Transition: From checkpoint saturation to release verification

PHASE: 34 → 38 STEPS (GATEWAY COMPLETION)
Action: Keep all 32 steps (21 actions + 11 validations), expand to 6 gateways total
Method: Add 4 more gateways for staged release verification path
Gateway positions: Foundation, validation infrastructure, core system, integration, pre-production, production
Result: 32 steps + 6 gateways = 38 items total
Gateway types: Each has automated tests and manual review criteria
Naming: GATEWAY_01 through GATEWAY_06, all items renumbered STEP_01 through STEP_38
Category: Gateway completion phase (final)
CRITICAL: This is final phase - renumber everything as STEP_XX

[VALIDATION BEFORE PROCEEDING]

Before executing next phase, verify:
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md exists and is readable
- [ ] Current phase has correct separator "<--- TRUST THE PROCESS --->"
- [ ] Step count matches expected number for current phase
- [ ] Identify if in action phase (1-21), checkpoint phase (21-32), or gateway phase (32-38)
- [ ] Git working directory is clean (or changes are intentional)
- [ ] Currently on correct development branch

-----

[ERROR RECOVERY]

If step count doesn't match expected hybrid progression:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report discrepancy to user
3. Identify which phase category (action/checkpoint/gateway)
4. Check if transition point crossed (21 or 32)
5. Ask user: "Detected X steps but expected Y. Proceed with recovery or manual intervention?"
6. Wait for user confirmation before continuing

If phase category ambiguous:
1. Reference phase boundaries: 1-21 (action), 22-32 (checkpoint), 33-38 (gateway)
2. Count action steps vs validation steps vs gateways separately
3. If confusion persists, ask user which phase to execute

If IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md missing or corrupted:
1. STOP immediately
2. Report error to user
3. Do NOT attempt automatic recovery
4. Wait for user to restore or provide guidance

[COMPARISON TO OTHER PROCESSES]

When user asks which process to use:

PROCESS_1 (1→3→6→12→24→36→42→48→52→56):
- Systematic doubling approach
- Reaches 36 implementation steps + 12 validations
- Best for: Well-defined production implementations
- Total: 56 items (48 steps + 8 gateways)

PROCESS_2 (1→2→3→5→8→13→21→34→36→42→48→52→56):
- Pure Fibonacci approach
- Reaches 36 implementation steps + 12 validations
- Best for: Exploratory or research-heavy projects
- Total: 56 items (48 steps + 8 gateways)

PROCESS_03 (1→3→5→8→13→21→24→32→34→38):
- Hybrid Fibonacci + saturation
- Reaches 21 implementation steps + 11 validations + 6 gateways
- Best for: Projects prioritizing validation density over action granularity
- Best for: Regulated environments requiring extensive checkpoints
- Total: 38 items (21 actions + 11 validations + 6 gateways)

Recommend PROCESS_03 when:
- Quality gates more critical than implementation detail
- Team prefers fewer but well-validated action steps
- Project has high compliance requirements
- Staged release verification path important
- 21 action steps provide sufficient granularity
